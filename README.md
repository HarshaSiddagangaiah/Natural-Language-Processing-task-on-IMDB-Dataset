Build a Convolutional Neural Network model for sentiment analysis, which helps the businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback and understand customer needs. Implemented Stochastic Gradient Decent to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs. Tuned the Hyper-parameters to achieve the best accuracy of 83% in the testing data
